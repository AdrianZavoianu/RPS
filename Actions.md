Now I want to move to implement the export features. The export at the project level will have 2 main option export project and export data. Export project will export everything needed to re-inport the current project on another device. Th export data will save all the results in individual tables similar with the output for the @Old_scripts. Also combine all into one file should be possible. Options for the export files type shall be excel and csv. Lets plan the implementation of this
