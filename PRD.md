# Results Processing App

I want to create an app that allows users to process results from formatted excel files with various type of results in different files and different sheets of this excel files.

I want this data parsed, organized and saved in db format for further analysis and visualization.

I already have some python scripts for the parsing and processing of the results in @Old_scripts folder. The typical excel input is shown in @Typical_Input folder.

The app has to display the results in a user friendly way and allow the user to select the results to be processed and saved in the db. Also this has to be expandable for dynamic time series visualization and statistical prcessing.

Another direction of extension is displaying results visualization over the 3D model of the building in order to observe the distribution of the results relative to the building geometry.
