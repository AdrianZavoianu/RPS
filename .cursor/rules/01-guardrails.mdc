**1. Security always enforced:**  
Never expose secrets, tokens, or unsafe file operations. Validate at least high-risk inputs (auth, DB writes).

**2. Fail visibly, not silently:**  
If logic is unclear or inputs invalid, raise errors immediately instead of logging or hiding failures.

**3. No schema mutations without consent:**  
Do not alter databases, indexes, or models beyond whatâ€™s necessary for iteration unless approved.

**4. No production dependencies:**  
Avoid complex observability, feature flags, or analytics libraries at this stage.

**5. Data safety:**  
Do not perform destructive or irreversible database operations. Work in isolated dev environments.

**6. Fallback values:**  
Dont use fallback values or mock data for prototyping, use the real data if possible.

**7. Rapid dependency adoption:**  
You may add libraries that significantly speed iteration as long as they are well-maintained and compatible with the tech stack.

**8. Documentation optional:**  
Write comments only for unclear logic or to mark areas requiring later improvement.
