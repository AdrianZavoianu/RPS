**No fallback values:** Do not use defaults, hardcoded placeholders, or assumptions unless explicitly defined. Missing/invalid inputs must fail fast with an error and request clarification.

**No schema changes without approval:** Do not create, alter, or drop DB tables, columns, indexes, or constraints without explicit instruction. Stop and ask if changes appear necessary.

**No unsolicited backward compatibility:** Do not add legacy support or compatibility layers unless specifically requested. Ask first if relevant.

**Default computation rule:** Do not perform significant computation on the frontend. The DB is the source of truth; frontend handles presentation and light transforms only. Heavy processing and business logic belong on the backend.

**Dependencies (guarded allowance):** Prefer existing stack libs. New libraries/frameworks may be added if well-maintained, actively supported, and clearly improve productivity, maintainability, or performance. Document the purpose and rationale.

**Error handling:** No silent failures. Fail fast with meaningful, structured errors. Never log or expose sensitive details.

**Security:** No hardcoded secrets, insecure crypto, or unsafe file handling. Validate and sanitize all inputs. Enforce least privilege, CSRF, and strict CORS.

**Data integrity:** Preserve integrity always. No destructive ops or irreversible migrations without explicit approval. Migration scripts must include validation and rollback.

**Documentation:** Document intent, inputs/outputs, and edge cases for new modules/APIs. Use comments for *why*, names for *what/how*.
